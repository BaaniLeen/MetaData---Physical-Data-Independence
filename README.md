# MetaData-Physical_Data_Independence

Physical Data Independence is one of the compelling reasons why Databases are needed to store information.

Physical data independence is the power to change the physical data without impacting the schema or logical data.


Physical data independence allows independence from details about how the data is
stored at disk sector, segment or in file.

program1_2016234.py represents how data in the database can be accessed without using the metafile, while program2_2016234.py uses the metafile to access the database.

Test contains two cases of programs, one wherein a new attribute is added to the database, and the other where the order of the attributes changes.
In both the cases, program1 fails while program2, using the metafile runs successfully.
